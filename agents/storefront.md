# Storefront (`apps/storefront`)

> Context for AI agents in the Next.js customer storefront. Keep accurate.

## Maintaining this file

Follow **Maintaining project documentation** in `agents/overview.md`. Update this file and the package README if setup/run changes.

## Overview

Next.js App Router storefront from the Medusa DTC starter. Talks to the Medusa Store API. Port default: **8000**.

This is the **customer** surface only. House portal is a draft hypothesis (ADR 0003), out of scope for Now. Brand config layer is Later (`docs/plan.md`).

## Architecture and flow

- Next.js 15 + React 19
- Medusa JS SDK (`@medusajs/js-sdk`) with publishable key
- Tailwind-based UI from the starter
- DX stack (shadcn/ui, i18next, Zustand, TanStack Query) is Next in `docs/plan.md`, not Now

## Patterns to follow when extending

1. Always send `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (SDK config). Missing key causes opaque store API failures.
2. Prefer URL-driven listing/filter state for shareable facet UX.
3. Basket UX must eventually group by house; starter cart is single-merchant shaped until the engine spike lands.
4. Editorial/CMS blocks that embed products must resolve live commerce data at render time.
5. Keep brand tokens (colors, copy, imagery) out of core cart/checkout logic when introducing the config layer.

## Environment variables

`apps/storefront/.env.local` (gitignored), from `.env.template`:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL` (local default `http://localhost:9000`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (`pk_...`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_REGION` (seed default often `gb`)

## Scripts / commands

From `apps/storefront`:

- `pnpm run dev` → Next on port 8000
- `pnpm run build` / `pnpm run start`
- `pnpm run lint` → `next lint` today

## Gotchas and notes

- Confirm `apps/storefront/` exists before storefront-only tasks.
- Do not commit `.env.local`.
- Backend and storefront are separate processes; backend-only `dev` does not start port 8000.
